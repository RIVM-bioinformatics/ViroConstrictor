# ViroConstrictor

ViroConstrictor is a pipeline designed to process raw FASTQ data from amplicon-based sequencing experiments and generate a biologically accurate consensus sequence of the sequenced genome.

ViroConstrictor performs high-speed data quality control, data cleanup, and highly accurate removal of primer sequences from NGS reads, as well as aligning reads and generating a consensus sequence using the [TrueConsense](https://rivm-bioinformatics.github.io/TrueConsense/0.5.1/) consensus caller, which accounts for sequencing errors and alignment artefacts.

ViroConstrictor can run on both standalone (Linux) computers and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures.

ViroConstrictor is compatible with Nanopore, Illumina, and IonTorrent data (FASTQ).

Please see the [getting started](installation.md) page for download and installation instructions, and refer to the [user guide page](manual.md) for basic usage instructions.

ViroConstrictor is available under the [AGPLv3 licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
