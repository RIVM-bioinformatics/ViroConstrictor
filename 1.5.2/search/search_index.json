This information is important because given primers will be removed from the reads during the analysis.</p> <p>In the ViroConstrictor pipeline the primer-removal is done by our tool AmpliGone.</p> <p>The information regarding the \"amplicon type\" is required because it tells te pipeline, and therefore also AmpliGone, from which side(s) of a read the primer-sequence has to be removed.</p> <p>Currently there are two options: \"End-to-End\" or \"End-to-Mid\".  </p> <p>In short: \"End-to-End\" means that the sequenced read covers the full length of an amplicon. Meaning that the primer-sequence is present at both ends of a read. \"End-to-Mid\" means that the sequences read only partially covers the length of the amplicon. Meaning that the primer-sequence is present at only one end of a read.</p> <p>Also see the AmpliGone documentation regarding amplicon-types where we go into more detail regarding these types and what these terms mean. Please check your sequencing and laboratory setup for the amplicon type to match your analysis to ensure the best results.</p>"},{"location":"changelog/","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#152-2025-04-02","title":"1.5.2

The primary goal of this system is to allow for different analysis settings, or differentiating analysis methods, tailored to a specific pathogen, or group of pathogens, that is being analyzed. As an example, even though Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are both respiratory viruses, they require some different analysis settings to ensure the best possible results as the viral-genomes and the sequencing-protocols are very different (segmented vs non-segmented).</p> <p>A preset can be set both for an entire analysis-run with the <code>--target/--preset</code> flag or on a per-sample basis through the \"Virus\" column in the samplesheet. The input value does not have to completely correspond to a defined preset, the closest matching preset is chosen unless there is not enough certainty (&lt;40%) to match the input to a preset. If there is not enough certainty to match the input to a preset then the \"DEFAULT\" preset/settings will be used as a fallback.</p> <p>Disabling the use of presets</p> <p>The use of presets can be disabled by providing the <code>--disable-presets/-dp</code> flag.
